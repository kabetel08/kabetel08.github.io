About Me 
======
Hi, I’m Karla!

I’m passionate about using data to shape policies that make a real difference in people’s lives. At the California Policy Lab, I worked on projects ranging from expanding access to food assistance and tax credits for low-income families to evaluating automatic record clearance and housing voucher programs. Those experiences showed me how rigorous data analysis can uncover inequities and inform solutions that advance justice and opportunity.

Now as a Master of Public Policy student at UC Berkeley, I continue bridging research and advocacy through work with organizations like the Vera Institute of Justice, The Possibility Lab, and the Latino Coalition for a Healthy California. I thrive at the intersection of policy and data, whether it’s designing research studies, collaborating with communities, or translating evidence into action.
